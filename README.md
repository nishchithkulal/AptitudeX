# 🚀 AptitudeX – Secure Online Assessment Platform

AptitudeX is a full-stack online assessment platform designed to provide secure, scalable, and reliable online examinations. The platform follows a **Zero-Trust Architecture**, where all critical operations—including grading, timing, and anti-cheat enforcement—are handled entirely on the backend.

Built as a production-style project, AptitudeX demonstrates modern full-stack development practices, backend security, role-based access control, and real-world examination workflows.
